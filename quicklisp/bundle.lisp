;;; Bundling is taking a set of Quicklisp-provided systems and
;;; creating a directory structure and metadata in which those systems
;;; can be loaded without involving Quicklisp.
;;;
;;; This works only for systems that are directly provided by
;;; Quicklisp. It can't reach out into ASDF-land and copy sources
;;; around.
